# SMFPlayer-Desktop Support Page

[日本語](README.md)

## Overview
This application reads SMF (Standard MIDI File) and sends MIDI data to MIDI devices connected to your Mac.

## Features
1. MIDI data is copied to the storage area used by the application for processing, so the original data is never edited or deleted.
2. Displays performance information graphically on the keyboard display.
3. You can create a playlist featuring your favorites.

## Usage
When you download this application and use it for the first time, add the MIDI file you want to use to this application.

After that, you can play them back or create a playlist of your favorites.

### Import MIDI files into the application
Drag and drop MIDI files into the application.

When you drag and drop a folder, it will be added to the application while preserving its folder hierarchy.

- The list of imported files can be viewed in the application like the Finder.
- Clicking the “SMF Folder” button in the upper-right corner of the window will open the location where imported files are saved in Finder.
- MIDI files and folders added or removed in Finder will be reflected in the application, even if they are not dragged and dropped into the application.

#### Editing imported files
Imported files can be moved, deleted, have folders created for them, or have their names changed in Finder, but they can also be edited in the same way within the application.

File movement is possible via drag and drop.

The following operations will display a context menu when you press Control + click or right-click.

- Display the file in Finder
- Create folder
- Renaming files and folders
- Deleting files and folders
